# GameHub

GameHub is a video game discovery web app that helps you find new and interesting games to play. With GameHub, you can search for games by platform, genre, and more. 

This is the project I build in my Ultimate React course.

## Getting Started

To get started with GameHub, follow these steps:


1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
3. Get a RAWG API key at https://rawg.io/apidocs. You'll have to create an account first. 
4. Add the API key to **src/services/api-client.ts**
5. Run `npm run dev` to start the web server.
